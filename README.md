# 🚦 Road Safety Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **road accident data** using **Power BI** to identify key patterns, trends, and risk factors that impact road safety.  
The dashboard is designed to be **interactive, user-friendly, and insightful**, helping policymakers, researchers, and safety authorities make data-driven decisions.

**Dataset Source:** Road Safety Dataset

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard consists of multiple pages covering different perspectives of road safety:

### 1. Overview Dashboard
- Total accidents & casualties  
- Accident severity distribution (Slight, Serious, Fatal)  
- Trends by month and day of the week  

### 2. Vehicle & Weather Breakdown
- Accidents by vehicle type (Cars, Vans, Motorcycles, etc.)  
- Impact of weather conditions on accident severity  
- Urban vs. Rural comparison  

### 3. Time & Speed Analysis
- Accidents by time of day (daylight vs. night)  
- Speed limit distribution at accident sites  
- Yearly trend comparison  

### 4. Environmental & Area Insights
- Junction type contributions (Controlled vs. Uncontrolled)  
- Road surface conditions (Wet, Snow, Flooded)  
- Urban vs. Rural accident severity patterns  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Friday and October** recorded the highest accident counts.  
- **Cars** dominate accident involvement, but **motorcycles** have higher severity rates.  
- **Urban areas** have more accidents, while **rural areas** see deadlier ones.  
- **Adverse weather** (rain, fog, snow) significantly increases accident severity.  
- **Give way/Uncontrolled junctions** are major accident hotspots.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Increase **traffic enforcement and awareness campaigns** during high-risk times (Fridays & October).  
- Improve **junction control infrastructure** with signals and signboards.  
- Provide **two-wheeler safety training**, especially in rural regions.  
- Enhance **emergency response systems** in remote areas.  
- Encourage **cautious driving in fine weather**, where overconfidence leads to negligence.
